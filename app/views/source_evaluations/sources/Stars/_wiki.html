<h1>Milky Way</h1>
<h4>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h4>
<hr>
<p>The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains the Earth.[10][a] This name derives from its appearance as a dim "milky" glowing band arching across the night sky, in which the naked eye cannot distinguish individual stars. The term "Milky Way" is a translation of the Classical Latin via lactea, from the Hellenistic Greek ???????? ?????? (pr. galaxias k?klos, "milky circle").[11][12][13]</p>
