<h1>How Many Stars are in Galaxies?</h1>
<p>As you probably know, galaxies aren't individual objects, but vast groupings of stars. In fact, vast isn't a big enough word to describe how many stars there are in galaxies. So, how many stars are in galaxies?</p>
<p>Well, that question depends on the type of the galaxy. The smallest galaxies are called dwarf galaxies. They're too small to form the vast spiral shape that we see in galaxies like the Milky Way and Andromeda. A dwarf galaxy can have as few as 10 million stars. These dwarf galaxies are constantly being absorbed into larger and larger galaxies.</p>
