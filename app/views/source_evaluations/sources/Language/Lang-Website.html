                  <h1>Your 24-month-old's language and cognitive development: Asking questions</h1>
                    <hr>
		    <h3>New this month: Asking questions</h3>
		    <p>Your 2-year-old has probably blossomed into a little conversationalist. She's likely asking questions in an attempt to keep a conversation going and loves to answer simple questions as well. Her sense of herself as an individual is growing, and she'll relish any opportunity to tell you what she likes and doesn't like. She may be adding one or more words to her vocabulary every day. A typical 2-year-old has a vocabulary of about 50 words, although some have many more. Your child can probably name dozens of things she sees regularly, including items around the house (bed, door, chair), animals, (dog, cat, bird, fish), and familiar people. She may be able to ask for specific kinds of food and drink, such as apple juice, cracker, banana, and so on. Noting the absence of things is common at this age, such as "all gone milk." She also understands the concept of "more" and may be able to ask for "more cookie."</p>
		    <h3>What you can do</h3>
		    <p>Continue to entertain your child with nursery rhymes and other forms of word play. She loves the repetition, especially now that she can repeat some words along with you. If you're running out of toddler activity ideas, visit our BabyCenter Community and ask the other parents for their favorite songs and rhymes. Keep reading books aloud to your child every day, too. Choose plenty of picture books that feature activities your toddler does, such as riding in a car, going to the zoo or the market, and playing at the park. Be sure to ask her questions about these books and how these activities relate to her own life. Her answers will give her plenty of opportunities to use her growing vocabulary and share her own likes, dislikes, and personal experiences.</p>
		    <h3>Other developments: Exploring, language and cognitive milestones</h3>
		    <p>At age 2, most toddlers have some understanding of the space around them. If yours uses words such as "up" and "out," that's a good indicator that she's beginning to understand this concept. When she draws, your toddler can probably make a "V," a circle, and vertical and horizontal lines, though her renderings may be crude. She's still using her senses to explore objects, but you might notice more sophisticated observations and comparisons, such as the cat is "soft" just like her favorite "blankie." Some children also know their colors at this age and can count to five or ten.</p>
		    <p>As a fun activity and a great conversation starter, make a book featuring the antics of your 2-year old. All you need is a small photo album and pictures of her doing various things at home and outside. Look at the book together and talk about the pictures. "Here you are climbing up the slide at the park," or "Here you are rolling on the grass with your doggie." Then ask her questions like, "What are you doing in this picture?" She'll love answering your questions and having a starring role in a "book." And you'll have a fantastic keepsake of this special time in your toddler's life.</p>
		    <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics has a list of language and cognitive skill "milestones" that most children reach by their second birthday. Your 2-year-old should be able to:
			<ul>
			    <li>Point to an object that you name</li>
			    <li>Recognize the names of familiar people, objects, and body parts</li>
			    <li>Use short phrases and two- to four-word sentences</li>
			    <li>Follow simple instructions</li>
			    <li>Repeat words she overhears</li>
			    <li>Find objects even when you hide them under two or three blankets</li>
			    <li>Sort objects by shape or color</li>
			    <li>Play make-believe</li>
			</ul>
