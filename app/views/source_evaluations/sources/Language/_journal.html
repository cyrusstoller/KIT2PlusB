<h1>The Role of Home Literacy Practices in Preschool Children's Language and Emergent Literacy Skills</h1>
<hr>
<p>
  This study examined how 4 specific measures of home literacy practices (i.e.,
  shared book reading frequency, maternal book reading strategies, child’s
  enjoyment of reading, and maternal sensitivity) and a global measure of the quality
  and responsiveness of the home environment during the preschool years
  predicted children’s language and emergent literacy skills between the ages of
  3 and 5 years. Study participants were 72 African American children and their
  mothers or primary guardians primarily from low-income families whose home
  literacy environment and development have been followed since infancy. Annually,
  between 18 months and 5 years of age, the children’s mothers were interviewed
  about the frequency they read to their child and how much their child enjoyed
  being read to, and the overall quality and responsiveness of the home environment
  were observed. Mothers also were observed reading to their child once a year at
  2, 3, and 4 years of age, and maternal sensitivity and types of maternal book
  reading strategies were coded. Children’s receptive and expressive language and
  vocabulary were assessed annually between 3 years of age and kindergarten
  entry, and emergent literacy skills were assessed at 4 years and kindergarten entry.
  The specific home literacy practices showed moderate to large correlations with
  each other, and only a few significant associations with the language and literacy
  outcomes, after controlling for maternal education, maternal reading skills, and
  the child’s gender. The global measure of overall responsiveness and support of
  the home environment was the strongest predictor of children’s language and early
  literacy skills and contributed over and above the specific literacy practice
  measures in predicting children’s early language and literacy development.
</p>

<p>
  Understanding how the home literacy environment affects the
  acquisition of children’s later language and emergent literacy
  knowledge has become of increasing interest during the past three
  decades (Lonigan, Burgess, & Anthony, 2000; Neuman & Dickinson,
  2001; Se´ ne´ chal & LeFevre, 2002; Whitehurst & Lonigan, 1998). Children who acquire successful initial reading skills tend to remain good
  readers, while children who experience difficulty in learning to read
  tend to continue to have problems in reading throughout the school
  years (Adams, 1990; Baydar, Brooks-Gunn, & Furstenberg, 1993;
  Cunningham & Stanovich, 1997; National Research Council, 1998).
  Considerable research has shown children’s emergent literacy skills—
  the skills, knowledge, and attitudes that are necessary for the development of reading and writing (Sulzby, 1989; Teale & Sulzby, 1986)—are important for later reading success (Lonigan et al., 2000;
  Se´ ne´ chal & LeFevre, 2002; Storch & Whitehurst, 2002;
  Wagner et al., 1997). The experiences, attitudes, and
  materials pertaining to literacy that a child encounters
  and interacts with at home compose a child’s home literacy environment (Leseman & DeJong, 1998; Payne,
  Whitehurst, & Angell, 1994; Se´ ne´chal, LeFevre, Thomas,
  & Daley, 1998; Whitehurst & Lonigan, 1998). A number of studies have reported relationships between the
  home literacy environment (in particular, shared book
  reading interactions) and children’s later language and
  literacy skills (DeJong & Leseman, 2001; Haden, Reese,
  & Fivush, 1996; Se´ ne´chal & LeFevre, 2002; van Kleeck,
  Gillam, Hamilton, & McGrath, 1997).
</p>
<p>
  In order to understand the role of the home literacy
  environment in children’s later language and development, it is important to examine how specific aspects of
  the home literacy environment contribute to children’s
  later language and literacy development. This study
  examined the extent to which specific home literacy
  practices (frequency of shared book reading, maternal
  strategies and sensitivity during book reading, children’s interest in reading) and a global measure of the
  overall responsiveness of the home environment during the preschool years related to children’s language
  and emergent literacy skills between the ages of 3 and
  5 years. Study participants were African American
  preschoolers primarily from low-income families whose
  development and family environments had been prospectively studied since infancy.
</p>
<h3>Frequency of Book Reading</h3>
<p>
  A method frequently used to assess the home
  literacy environment has been to obtain information
  from parent questionnaires about the frequency that
  parents read to their children (Chaney, 1994; Dickinson
  & DeTemple, 1998; Frijters, Barron, & Brunello,
  2000; Leseman & DeJong, 1998; Payne et al., 1994).
  Scarborough and Dobrich (1994), in a review of research studies on the influence of parent–child reading
  experiences on the development of children’s language
  and literacy skills, reported that parents read to their
  children an average of 4.5 to 10.5 times per week and
  that children from low-income families are read to
  less frequently by their parents than children of middle socioeconomic status. In a meta-analyses published
  in 1994, Scarborough and Dobrich reported the frequency of shared book reading during the preschool
  years accounted for 7% of the variance in children’s
  emergent literacy skills at entry to school, 8% of the
  variance in children’s reading achievement from kindergarten through 3rd grade, and 7% of the variance
  in preschool children’s language development. Similarly, Bus, van IJzendoorn, and Pellegrini (1995)
  reported that the frequency of shared book reading
  during the preschool years accounted for about 8% of
  the variance in children’s later literacy achievement,
  decreasing in strength as children’s literacy skills increased. Although these reported associations on the
  impact of the frequency of shared book reading on
  children’s development are modest, the importance of
  shared reading on later literacy and language development warrants further study.
</p>
<h3>Child Interest During Book Reading</h3>
<p>
  Another potential factor that has been studied in relation to children’s development of language and literacy skills is a child’s interest in literacy activities (Frijters et al., 2000; Payne et al., 1994; Se´ ne´chal,
  LeFevre, Hudson, & Lawson, 1996). Bus (2003) noted that the role of parents is to create an interactional context that encourages a child’s interest in reading. In their review, Scarborough and Dobrich (1994) reported that a child’s perceived interest in literacy accounted
  for about 14% of the variance in children’s language
  and literacy outcomes and that this correlation was
  higher than those reported for the frequency and quality measures assessed during shared book reading.
  More recent studies also have reported a link between
  children’s interest in shared book reading measured by
  parents’ or the child’s own rating of their interest or by
  children’s request to be read to (Frijters et al., 2000;
  Payne et al., 1994; Senechal et al., 1996) and children’s
  language development. The impact of children’s interest in literacy has been less studied compared to the
  frequency or quality of interactions during shared book
  reading; a child’s interest in literacy activities may be
  an important factor contributing to children’s language
  and early literacy development.
</p>
<h3>Maternal Book Reading Strategies</h3>
<p>
  In addition to studying the frequency of shared book
  reading, other research has focused on more qualitative
  measures of book reading, such as the impact of specific
  types of interactions that occur between parents and
  their children during shared book reading on children’s
  literacy and language development (Haden et al., 1996;
  Leseman & DeJong, 1998; Pellegrini, Perlmutter,
  Galda, & Brody, 1990; Reese & Cox, 1999; van Kleeck
  et al., 1997). In their meta-analyses of correlational
  studies, Scarborough and Dobrich (1994) reported that
  the quality of shared book reading during the preschool
  years accounted for only 4% of the variance in children’s
  emergent literacy skills and accounted for a smaller
  degree of association with children’s emergent literacy and language skills than did the frequency of shared
  book reading. In meta-analyses of intervention studies
  that attempted to modify the quality of parental book
  reading to increase children’s language and literacy
  skills, Scarborough and Dobrich reported mild associations accounting for 3%–8% of the variance in children’s
  language and literacy skills. More recent correlational
  studies (Haden et al., 1996; van Kleeck et al., 1997) and
  intervention studies (Lonigan & Whitehurst, 1998;
  Whitehurst, Arnold, et al., 1994; Whitehurst, Epstein,
  et al., 1994; Whitehurst et al., 1988) have shown that
  specific parent behaviors, such as asking open-ended
  questions, adding information, focusing on print concepts, and eliciting abstract language, are related to
  children’s later language skills. A few studies have
  reported different strategies in book reading among
  low-income African American mothers and both lowand middle-income White mothers (Anderson-Yockel &
  Haynes, 1994; Heath, 1983). For example, Heath (1983)
  described how low-income African American families
  in comparison to White middle-class families had fewer
  books, read less to children, placed less emphasis on
  literacy-related activities, and used a different style
  when reading to children. Yet, Pelligrini and colleagues
  (1990) reported that, similar to what had been found
  in other studies of middle-class children, mothers of
  Head Start preschoolers adjusted their strategies to
  the cognitive demand level of their child and redirected
  children’s attention during joint book reading. These
  studies provide some support that mothers’ use of
  certain types of communicative behaviors during book
  reading interactions may facilitate children’s early language and literacy development, although their impact
  on children’s language and literacy development needs
  further study.
</p>
<h3>Maternal Sensitivity</h3>
<p>
  Another measure of home literacy practices, qualitative ratings of parents’ (which we refer to as maternal instead of parental, since most of the literature
  focuses on mothers) sensitivity and responsiveness to
  children, has been well documented as influencing children’s language development (Landry, Smith, Swank,
  & Miller-Loncar, 2000; National Institute of Child
  Health & Human Development, Early Child Care Research Network [NICHD ECCRN], 2000, 2002). A sensitive, responsive, and supportive style by mothers
  during book reading and other literacy related activities is thought to support positive mother–child interactions, provide a child with the encouragement and
  motivation to participate in literacy-related interactions, and support language and cognitive development.
  In a recent study of more than 500 mothers and their
  children, the NICHD ECCRN (2000) reported that ratings of responsive, sensitive caregiving from birth
  to 3 years of age were related to children’s cognitive
  and language development through age 3 years. A
  follow-up analysis of outcomes at 4O years showed
  that maternal sensitivity and responsiveness (i.e., sensitive, stimulating, and supportive maternal behavior)
  was the strongest single predictor of children’s language and preacademic skills at entry to kindergarten
  (NICHD ECCRN, 2002). Other studies have shown that
  the social emotional quality of the interactions, as measured by factors such as supportive presence, respect
  for the child’s autonomy, structuring, and limit setting
  by parents, appeared to be a factor independent of other
  aspects of home literacy interactions in predicting children’s language and reading skills during the early elementary school years (Bus, Leseman, & Keultjes, 2000;
  DeJong & Leseman, 2001). Given the considerable literature support for the influence of maternal responsiveness on children’s language development, it is
  important to consider its role in children’s acquisition
  of language and emergent literacy skills compared with
  other measures of the home literacy environment.
</p>
<h3>Overall Home Enviornment</h3>
<p>
  In addition to quantitative and qualitative measures of shared book reading and the home literacy
  environment, it is also important to examine the role
  of more general characteristics of the home environment in children’s development of language and literacy
  skills. It is possible that it is not just the frequency
  of reading, specific language-eliciting interactions,
  and social emotional processes that go on during literacy activities, but also more general dimensions in
  the child’s environment that have an impact on children’s language and literacy development. Thus, parents who are responsive, sensitive, and accepting of a
  child’s behavior, and who provide structure, organization, and a positive general emotional climate at home,
  along with stimulating toys and interactions, facilitate
  children’s language and early literacy development. Over
  the past 50 years, a body of research has demonstrated
  linkages between children’s home environment and their
  development (Bradley, Corwyn, Burchinal, McAdoo, &
  Garcı´a Coll, 2001; Bradley, Corwyn, McAdoo, & Garcı´a
  Coll, 2001; NICHD ECCRN, 2000, 2002). Families whose
  homes are rated higher on the Home Observation for
  Measurement of the Environment Inventory (HOME;
  Caldwell & Bradley, 1984), a measure of the quality and
  quantity of stimulation and support available in the
  home, have been shown to score higher on later measures
  of language, cognitive, and academic skills (Bradley,
  Corwyn, Burchinal, et al., 2001; Bradley, Corwyn,
  McAdoo, & Garcı´a Coll, 2001). Burchinal and colleagues
  (Burchinal, Campbell, Bryant, Wasik, & Ramey, 1997)
</p>
<h3>Summary and Research Questions</h3>
<p>
  The relationship between the home literacy practices during the preschool years and children’s language and early literacy skills is not clear. Whether
  linkages between home literacy practices and children’s language and literacy skills differ over time has
  not previously been examined. Most studies examining
  the relationship between home literacy practices and
  children’s language and literacy development have documented family literacy practices only once; few studies
  have been longitudinal, with repeated assessments
  of both the predictors and outcomes of interest. Possibly, a responsive parenting style is important for
  early language and literacy development in the early
  preschool years when literacy learning is more meaningbased, while literacy focused maternal strategies may
  be more important in the later preschool years, when
  literacy learning is more print-based. Further, it is
  not clear if a global measure of the home environment contributes over and above the specific literacy
  practices to children’s language or literacy development. Understanding the role of home literacy practices in children’s language and literacy development
  during the preschool years has important implications
  for children’s later literacy success. The relationship
  between home literacy practices during the preschool
  years and children’s language and emergent literacy
  skills is important to study for African American
  children, particularly children from low-income families. A number of studies have shown that low-income
  African American children score lower on measures
  of language and emergent literacy skills during the
  preschool years and are at increased risk for literacy
  difficulties in school as compared to their nonminority cohorts (Byrd & Weitzman, 1994; Children’s Defense Fund, 2001; The College Board, 1999; Jencks
  & Phillips, 1998; Patterson, 1997; Snow, Burns, &
  Griffin, 1998). Further, a few studies have reported
  that low-income African American families differ from
  middle-income families in both the quantity and quality of shared book reading and other literacy interactions
  (Dickinson & Tabors, 1991; Purcell-Gates, 1996). However, a few other researchers who have examined whether
  low-income African American parents differ in their
  frequency and/or quality of shared book reading interactions, compared with middle-class families, noted the considerable individual differences within low-income
  families and questioned whether these socioeconomic
  differences have an impact on children’s literacy development (Anderson, Anderson, Lynch, & Shapiro, 2003).
</p>
<p>
  This study examined the relationship between
  home literacy practices during the preschool years and
  the language and emergent literacy skills of African
  American children between the ages of 3 years and kindergarten entry, who were primarily from low-income
  families. In particular, the study examined whether
  four specific measures of home literacy practices (i.e.,
  parents’ perceptions of frequency of shared book reading and of how much a child enjoys being read to, maternal book reading strategies, and maternal sensitivity
  during shared book reading) could predict both the level
  of and change in children’s early language and literacy skills between 3 years of age and entry to kindergarten. Further, the study examined whether a global
  measure of the home environment could contribute over
  and above these specific home literacy practice measures in predicting children’s early language and literacy development during the preschool years.

<h2>Method</h2>
<h3>Participants</h3>
<p>
  The participants in this study were 72 African
  American children (39 girls and 33 boys) who were part
  of a larger longitudinal study that examined the relationship between children’s health and their development (Roberts et al., 1995). The children were recruited
  from community-based child care centers in several small
  southern cities. The criteria for study inclusion were as
  follows: African American, enrolled in child care, less
  than 12 months of age, and appearing to be typically
  developing. Children entered the study at a mean age
  of 8.1 months (SD = 2.0). In the current study, we
  included all children who continued to participate in
  the study but excluded from these analyses 4 children
  whose older sibling also participated in the study and
  2 children with developmental disorders
</p>
<p>
  The caregivers’ mean age at study onset was 25.7
  years (SD = 7.6), ranging from 14 to 63 years. At entry
  to the study, 91.8% of the caregivers were the children’s
  biological mothers. The remaining were fathers (1.4%),
  grandmothers (4.1%), or foster or adoptive mothers
  (2.7%). When the children entered the study, 28.4%
  of caregivers had less than a high school education,
  28.4% had a high school education, and 43.2% had
  education beyond high school. By the children’s entry
  to kindergarten, 18.9% of caregivers had less than a
  high school education, 16.2% had a high school education, and 64.9% had education beyond high school.
  At study onset, the majority of the families (74.3%) had an income that was G185% of the federal poverty
  threshold (income G$20,609 for a family of three) and
  were categorized as low-income. When the children
  entered kindergarten, 58% of the families had an
  income that was G185% of the federal poverty threshold. At study onset, 29.7% of the primary caregivers
  were married.
</p>
<h3>Overview of Study Procedures</h3>
<p>In this report, children were followed from their
  first year of life through entry to kindergarten. The majority of primary caregivers were mothers; therefore, all
  primary caregivers are referred to as mothers throughout this study. Family background measures (mother’s
  education level, mother’s reading level) were assessed
  at entry to the study. Mothers were given questionnaires
  regarding their children’s literacy behaviors when their
  children were 18, 30, and 42 months old and before
  kindergarten entry. Mothers’ communicative strategies
  and sensitivity during shared book reading were assessed when their children were 2, 3, and 4 years of
  age. The overall quality and responsiveness of the
  home environment were assessed at 9, 18, 30, and 42
  months of age and at entry to kindergarten. Children’s
  language and literacy development was assessed annually between 3 years of age and kindergarten entry.
  See Table 1 for an overview of when the home literacy
  measures were completed and when the study children
  completed the language and literacy assessments.</p>
  <h3>Background Measures</h3>
  <p>The education level of mothers was determined
    from self-report upon entry into the study. To determine reading level, the Wide Range Achievement Test—
    Revised (WRAT–R) (Jastak & Wilkinson, 1984) was
    administered to mothers at study onset. The WRAT–R
    is a brief achievement test with three subtests (Reading, Spelling, and Arithmetic). However, only the score
    from the Reading subtest was used in this study. The
    Reading subtest measures the ability to recognize and
    name letters and words. The WRAT–R has adequate
    levels of reliability and validity. The mean score of
    mothers on the WRAT–R was 92.1 (SD = 14.5).</p>
    <h3>Measures of Home Literacy Practices</h3>
    <h4>Frequency of Book Reading</h4>
    <p>Three trained project staff members used a questionnaire to intereview mothers (or the primary guardian) about their home literacy environment when their
      children were 18, 30, and 42 months of age and at kindergarten entry. The frequency of shared book reading
      was assessed with the question, ‘‘How often is your child
      read to?’’ The number of days per week (maximum = 7)
      that the parent reported reading to his or her child was
      computed and entered into the analysis.</p>
      <h4>Child's Interest in Reading</h4>
      <p>On the same home literacy questionnaire that
        assessed frequency of reading, mothers also were interviewed about the child’s enjoyment of book reading
        when children were 18, 30, and 42 months of age and
        at kindergarten entry. Mothers were asked, ‘‘Does
        your child enjoy being read to?’’ and were provided five
        choices: (1) not at all, (2) a little, (3) pretty much, (4) very
        much, or (5) loves it. The value mothers reported was
        entered into the analysis at each age.</p>
        <h4>Maternal Book Reading Strategies</h4>
        <p>The interactions of mothers and their children
          were videotaped for 10 min during shared book reading
          when the children were 2, 3, and 4 years of age. The
          interactions were coded for the type of information the
          parent relayed to the child while reading (McClelland,
          Hammett, Roberts, & Dunston, in review). The mother
          was asked to read to her child the way she would at
          home and was told the researcher would be outside the
          room. Age-appropriate books were provided, with one
          book at each session being a picture book without
          written words. The books were (a) for 2-year-olds, Max’s
          Bedtime (Wells, 1985), Find the Puppy (Cartwright &
          Zeff, 1983), and Cookie Monster’s Good Time to Eat
          (Brown, 1982); (b) for 3-year-olds, Yoo-hoo, Little Rabbit
          (Miller, 1986), Early Words (Scarry, 1976), and Carl’s
          Afternoon in the Park (Day, 1991); and (c) for 4-year-olds,
          Winnie the Pooh All Year Long (Walt Disney Productions,
          1981), Carl Goes Shopping (Day, 1989), and The Very
          Hungry Caterpillar (Carle, 1969).</p>
          <p>The category system for the coding of mothers’
            strategies during storybook reading was adapted from
            the work of Haden and colleagues (1996) and DeTemple
            (1994). The following strategies used by the mother to
            convey information were coded: simple description (i.e.,
            physical attribute of a character, animal, or object; simple action; or location description); elaborate description (i.e., explanation, summary, or elaboration of plot
            information, focusing on what is happening); links to
            the world (i.e., connection between real-world knowledge
            such as personal experiences and the book); prediction/
            inferences (i.e., predictions about what is going to
            happen in the text and reasoning about motivations,
            internal states, or causality); book concepts (i.e., references to books such as title, author, page-turning, or
            the process of reading); letter/word related references
            (i.e., references to words or letters as print, such as identifying the letter B); letter–sound relationships (i.e.,
            information about letter–sound relationships, such as
            rhyming or initial letter sound); and recall /recite of the
            text (i.e., pretend reading by the child, saying memorized text, or repetition of the text just read). The number of times the parent used each of these strategies
            was computed. See McClelland and Roberts (in review)
            for further details about the coding procedures. Intercoder reliability between two coders was calculated for
            10% of the sample using intraclass correlations and was
            .79 at 2 years, .83 at 3 years, and .81 at 4 years of age.
            In the analysis, the total frequency of these maternal
            strategies summed together was computed for each age.</p>
            <h4>Maternal Sensitivity</h4>
            <p>During the shared book reading interactions,
              the overall level of maternal sensitivity was coded. Maternal sensitivity was determined using MULTI-PASS
              (Marfo, 1992), a video coding scheme for analyzing parent–
              child interaction. For this study, maternal sensitivity was
              a composite variable computed from the means of the
              following six dimensions as defined in MULTI-PASS:
              (a) warmth—the extent to which the child’s mother displays positive affect to the child (e.g., patting, kissing,
              verbal endearments) or other actions depicting fondness; (b) sensitivity—the extent to which the child’s
              mother shows an awareness of and reads the child’s
              verbal and nonverbal cues and signals, and exhibits
              awareness of the child’s current developmental capabilities; (c) responsiveness—how promptly, consistently, and
              appropriately the child’s mother responds to the child’s
              cues, interests, and overt behaviors; (d) encouragement of
              initiative—determined by how the child’s mother’s interaction style reflects awareness of the importance of a
              child’s need to be self-directed (e.g., expects the child to
              select next activity and encourages the child to explore
              tasks independently); (e) stimulation value—the extent
              to which the mother orients her interactions toward providing cognitive or linguistic stimulation to the child
              (e.g., uses teachable moments to promote cognitive
              or linguistic competence); and (f) elaborateness—the
              degree to which the parent follows, expands, or elaborates on the child’s verbal and nonverbal behaviors. See
              Wallace and colleagues (Wallace, Roberts, & Lodder,
              1998) for more details about the coding procedure.</p>
              <p>Two African American coders coded the interactions
                of mothers from videotapes of mother–child book reading
                interactions to determine the levels of these behaviors.
                Each behavior was coded using a 5-point rating scale,
                with 1 indicating the lowest amount of the behavior and
                5 indicating the highest amount of the behavior. Interrater agreement was computed for 10% of the tapes
                and averaged across the six dimensions and was .55 at
                2 years, .69 at 3 years, and .61 at 4 years using kappa.
                A kappa of greater than .4 indicates good-to-moderate
                agreement (Cohen, 1968). The results of a factor analysis at each age indicated that the six mother–child
                interaction variables that were used to form the sensitivity composite variable were highly correlated: at
                2 years, the Cronbach coefficient alpha was .77, at
                3 years, the Cronbach coefficient alpha was .79, and
                at 4 years, the Cronbach coefficient alpha was .89</p>
                <h4>Overall Responsiveness of the Home Environment</h4>
                <p>The overall quality and responsiveness of the home
                  environment were assessed using the HOME for infants–
                  toddlers at 18 months and early childhood at 30 months,
                  42 months, and at entry to kindergarten. The HOME is
                  a 45-item semistructured observation/interview that
                  measures the primary caregiver’s emotional and verbal responsivity, acceptance of the child’s behavior, organization of the environment, academic and language stimulation, and maternal involvement with the child. The
                  HOME has had considerable norming and standardization and has been widely used in studies (e.g., Bradley,
                  Corwyn, Burchinal, et al., 2001; Bradley, Corwyn,
                  McAdoo, & Garcı´a Coll, 2001; Bradley, Corwyn, &
                  Whiteside-Mansell, 1996). Moderate internal consistency, acceptable levels of test–retest reliability, and
                  high levels of content validity have been reported for
                  HOME scores for White and African American families (Bradley et al., 1996; Bradley, Corwyn, Burchinal,
                  et al., 2001; Bradley, Corwyn, McAdoo, & Garcı´a Coll,
                  2001; Caldwell & Bradley, 1984). During the 5-year period, home visits were conducted by two trained nurse
                  practitioners and two speech-language pathologists who
                  had achieved interrater agreement of at least 95% before collecting the data. The proportion of items passed
                  for the HOME total score computed at each age was entered into the analysis.</p>
                  <h4>Measurement of Child Language and
                    Literacy Outcomes</h4>
                    <p>There were two different measures of children’s
                      language and one measure of emergent literacy that
                      were administered between 3 years and entry to kindergarten. Because this was a longitudinal study that
                      began in 1990,  children’s  language  and emergent
                      literacy skills were evaluated using the versions of
                      the tests that were current at the time period; more recent editions are now available. The Peabody Picture
                      Vocabulary Test—Revised (PPVT–R; Dunn & Dunn,
                      1981) was administered to study participants to assess receptive vocabulary at 3 years of age and at entry
                      to kindergarten, and a standard score was computed.
                      The Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals—
                      Preschool (CELF–P; Wiig, Secord, & Semel, 1992) was
                      administered to children at 4 years of age and kindergarten entry to measure receptive and expressive language
                      skills. The receptive language sections on the CELF–P
                      measure linguistic and basic concepts and sentence
                      structure, while the expressive sections measure the
                      ability to recall and repeat spoken sentences, formulation of labels, and word structure. Standard scores on
                      the CELF–P for receptive language (CELF-RL) and
                      expressive language (CELF-EL) were computed. The
                      Test of Early Reading Ability (TERA; Reid, Hresko, &
                      Hammil, 1981) examines children’s emergent literacy
                      knowledge as it relates to the alphabet, conventions
                      of print, and the ability to construct meaning from
                      print. The TERA was administered when children were
                      4 years old and at kindergarten entry. The mean age
                      of the study children when tested at kindergarten entry was 5 years, 3 months (SD = 3.4 months). The language and literacy outcome measures were selected
                      based on their standardization and adequate levels of
                      reliability and validity. Because of scheduling or other
                      related issues, all children were not included for all
                      data points in this longitudinal study. The number of
                      participants included in the analysis of each measure
                      is shown in the tables.</p>
                      <h3>Results</h3>
                      <h4>Analysis Strategy</h4>
                      <p>Analyses examined the extent to which the specific
                        home literacy practices related to children’s language
                        and emergent literacy skills between the ages of 3 years
                        and entry to kindergarten and compared those associations with the associations observed from a global measure of the home environment. There were four specific
                        home literacy practices collected during the preschool
                        years: (a) mothers’ report of the frequency of mother–
                        child shared book reading, (b) mothers’ report of their
                        child’s interest in book reading, (c) frequency of maternal communicative strategies during shared book
                        reading, and (d) ratings of maternal sensitivity during
                        shared book reading. There also was one global measure of the home environment, the HOME Total. We
                        predicted that the specific home literacy practices
                        would relate to children’s language and early literacy
                        between 3 years of age and entry to kindergarten. Further, we hypothesized that these associations would be
                        stronger than those observed between a global measure of the home environment, the HOME Total, and
                        children’s language and early literacy skills. The four
                        outcome measures were standardized scores collected
                        at various ages and included a measure of (a) receptive
                        vocabulary (PPVT–R) collected at 3 years and kindergarten entry, (b) receptive and expressive language
                        on the CELF–P (CELF-RL and CELF-EL) collected at
                        4 years and kindergarten entry, and (c) early literacy
                        (TERA) collected at 4 years and kindergarten entry.
                        The first 8 children who entered into the study were
                        not administered the CELF–P at kindergarten entry
                        because of a change in the protocol. Therefore, the number of children was lower for the CELF–P as compared
                        to the other measures at kindergarten entry.</p>
                        <p>Table 2 provides descriptive statistics for all of the
                          home literacy practices and child language and emergent
                          literacy outcomes at each age and also includes selected
                          child and maternal characteristics (child’s gender, maternal reading as measured by WRAT–R scores, and
                          highest level of years of mothers’ education) included
                          as covariates in some of the analyses. The maternal
                          WRAT–R and maternal education covariates, listed in
                          the first column, were collected when children entered
                          into the study. To provide descriptive information about the relationships of the home literacy predictors and the
                          covariates, intercorrelations were run among the five
                          home literacy and child and family background measures.</p>
                          <p>Repeated measures analyses were conducted (see
                            Singer, 1998, and NICHD ECCRN, 1998, for complete
                            details) to determine how the home literacy measures
                            predicted children’s language and literacy development. We wanted to know if the level (at both assessments for a particular measure) of children’s language
                            and literacy skills and change or rate of growth in
                            children’s language and literacy skills (between the
                            two assessments) during early childhood were related
                            to the home literacy practices. The repeated measures
                            analyses simultaneously predicted the overall level
                            and rate of change in children’s language and literacy
                            scores from literacy practices measures and selected covariates. The repeated measures analyses estimated
                            the mean of the repeated assessments as the intercept
                            and the difference between them as a slope. The main
                            effect for literacy activities in these analyses tested
                            the extent to which that activity related to the mean of
                            the repeated assessment. The Age  Literacy interaction
                            tested the extent to which that literacy activity related
                            to change over time on that outcome. These analyses allowed for repeated assessments of both the independent (i.e., home literacy activities) and the dependent
                            variables (i.e., children’s language and literacy skills).
                            We included in our model a global measure of family
                            literacy practice (i.e., the HOME and covariates—the
                            child’s gender, maternal education, and maternal reading skill). For the rating of child enjoyment, the ordinal
                            predictor was included in the analysis models as a categorical variable, with a linear contrast across the four
                            levels of this variable. Because of the number of possible
                            associations (i.e., five home literacy practices measures
                            and four child outcomes), findings are interpreted only
                            if the repeated measures analyses showed a consistent
                            pattern of association across the outcome measures.</p>
                            <p>In a follow-up analysis, we wanted to determine
                              whether the global measure of the home environment contributed over and above the four specific literacy practice
                              measures (i.e., reading frequency, enjoyment of reading,
                              book reading strategies, maternal sensitivity) in predicting children’s early language and literacy development.
                              The analysis  added  the HOME to a model that included
                              the four specific home literacy practice measures, the three
                              covariates, the child’s test age, and the interactions (among
                              age, the literacy practices, and the covariates).</p>
                              <h3> Home Literacy Practices</h3>
                              <p>The literacy questionnaire and HOME were administered at 18, 30, 42, and 54 months, and the mother–
                                child book reading interactions measure was administered at 24, 36, and 48 months, so for the analysis we
                                combined the 18 and 24 month data into a single record, the 30 and 36 month data into a single record, and
                                the 42 and 48 month data into a single record. That is,
                                we treated the 18 month literacy questionnaires and
                                HOME data and the 24 month mother–child interactions as if they were collected at the same age. Further,
                                we also treated the 48 month mother–child interaction
                                scores as if they were collected at 54 months, using a
                                carry-forward imputation approach.</p>
                                <p>As Table 2 illustrates, the literacy practices did not
                                  change markedly over time. Mothers reported on average reading to their children slightly more at 3 and
                                  4 years (4.7 times per week) than at 2 years (4.3 times
                                  per week) or at entry to kindergarten (3.6 times per
                                  week). The across-time correlations among these reports
                                  of frequency of reading ranged from .40 to .49 for number of days per week read to child. Mothers reported
                                  their child very much enjoyed or loved reading slightly
                                  more at 3 years (75%), kindergarten entry (73%), and
                                  4 years (80%), than at 2 years (63%). The across-time
                                  correlations among these reports were .14 to .59 for
                                  child enjoyment, considerably lower than for the other
                                  literacy environment measures we examined. The
                                  rating of maternal sensitivity was relatively consistent
                                  across ages, ranging from 3.8 at 2 and 4 years to 3.9 at
                                  3 years. Across-time correlations were mild to moderately correlated, varying from .33 to .47 for maternal
                                  sensitivity. Maternal reading strategies also were relatively consistent between 2 and 4 years, with mothers
                                  using 60.1 book reading strategies at 2 years, 60.0 strategies at 3 years, and 67.0 strategies at 4 years during the
                                  10-min book reading session. The across-time correlations were relatively high, ranging from .54 to .69 for
                                  reading strategies. Finally, the HOME Total scores
                                  (computed as the proportion of items passed) were also relatively stable, as reflected in both the mean proportions over time (.78 at 18 months, .81 at 30 months,
                                  .82 at 42 months, and .79 at 54 months) and the acrosstime correlations (.60–.75).</p>

                                    Measures at Each Age</h4>
                                    <p>Table 3 shows the intercorrelations among the four
                                      specific literacy practices (frequency of reading, child’s
                                      enjoyment of reading, maternal sensitivity, book reading strategy) and the HOME at age 18/24 months and
                                      the three covariates (child’s gender, maternal WRAT–R
                                      scores, and maternal education). Because the patterns
                                      of correlations were similar at the other ages, only the
                                      data at 18/24 months are included in the table. The other
                                      two tables for 36 and 48 months can be obtained from
                                      the first author. These correlations indicate there is
                                      considerable overlap among the various home literacy
                                      assessments. The two measures from the literacy
                                      questionnaire (frequency of reading and child’s enjoyment of reading) were moderately correlated with each
                                      other, as were the two measures from book-reading
                                      interactions (maternal sensitivity and book reading
                                      strategy). The global measure, HOME Total, was moderately to highly correlated with the four specific literacy practice measures. Maternal education was mildly
                                      correlated with only two of the four literacy practices—
                                      frequency of reading and maternal sensitivity—while
                                      moderately correlated with the more global measure
                                      of the HOME and the mothers’ measure of reading on
                                      the WRAT–R. In comparison, the mothers’ WRAT–R
                                      scores were less consistently and mildly correlated regarding the child’s enjoyment of reading and the HOME
                                      at 2 years. Gender was not significantly correlated with
                                      the specific or global literacy measures.</p>

                                        years and at kindergarten entry) indicated that the
                                        scores were highly correlated: .63 for PPVT–R, .64 for
