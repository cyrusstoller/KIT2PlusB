		      <p>It could be delayed speech because of no interaction with other children, but it could also be because he's a boy & generally they tend to develope a little slower than girls. (Girls are known to talk too much!ha, ha) My daughter talked long
sentences at about 17 months, but my 2yr old boy only says a few short understandable sentences. (mostly he babbles.) Just keep talking to him and maybe meet up with other SAHMs so he can play with other children. Don't be too worried at this age, he will suprise you one day and say things you didn't know he could even understand!</p>

	    <p>put him in a baby gym or daycare...this can help/affect his social development and speech...he might need to interact more</p>

	    <p>My frinds son is 19 months old and he doesnt talk either, he says mom and dad, thats it and my daughter is 18 months old and can say absolutely anything. But they dont try with him, he points and grunts for something and they give it to him they dont tell him what it is or ask or anything.

	    <p>You might consider taking him to a day care or somewhere he can interact with other children. I do know that reading with them helps with speech.</p>

	    <p>Doctors always tell us to speak often to babies,it could encourage him to communicate in a verbal manner.Also,if your child's doctor has ruled out any kind of neurological,etc. problems,I wouldn't worry!They say Einstein didn't talk till he was 7!(Just what I heard;)</p>

	    <p>that will not effect his speech,as long as you talk to him.however you should mix with other children,its important for there development,plus it helps when the time comes for him to go to nursery or school.if he has never played with others it will be very hard for him to adjust.why dont you go to a local play group or the park.it will also be good for you to meet other mums,you must get lonely .</p>

	    <p>my grandparents had a son like that so they made him ask for something if he wanted it or say a few words before he was given something. he got over not speaking after awhile. find some kids for him to hang out with also. hope this helps.</p>

	    <p>A typical 20-month-old has a spoken vocabulary of about 12-15 words. But even if your child isn't talking in simple sentences yet, she likely understands many more words than she can say. A good way to encourage your baby is to label things, like do you want your yellow cup or here is your blue dog.

	    <p>I agree with everyone's answers. Its important to talk talk talk whenever you can. "John" I am checking your diaper for a bowel movement. Oh! You had a bowel movement. I am picking your body up. I am placing you on the table. Now I am....." I do not want to go any farther! haha. Anyways, you can apply this to everything that is happening. It may seem silly at first, but I promise it helps!

	    <p>Not having other children around won't effect you child's speech development, as long as he is hearing someone speak regularly. 

Avoid the baby talk, and tell him about everything that's going on around him. 

If you are truly concerned about his development, speak to his pediatrician. Only a doctor can give you a proper diagnoses.</p>
