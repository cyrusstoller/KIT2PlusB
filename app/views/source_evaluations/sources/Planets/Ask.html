                            <p>I can only give you the conditions on which life like on earth could exist.
				<ul>
				    <li>A temperature of between ~3 and ~70 degrees celsius on average.</li>
				    <li>A star with a size between 0.5 and 1.5 times that of the sun.</li>
				    <li>A single star (sorry, it can't be a binary star: the orbit would be unstable).</li>
				    <li>A planet weight of between ~0.7 and ~4 times that of the earth</li>
				    <li>An atmosphere.</li>
				    <li>An electromagnetic field protecting it.</li>
				    <li>An old age.</li>
				</ul>

			<p>Water does not have to be required. Another solvent, like ammonia (NH3), as long as the planet has the right temperature and mass for the solvent to exist around the triple point of solvent so that it exists in a solid, liquid, and vapor form like water does on Earth, is all that is necessary. It will be more believable if the solvent is is magnetically polarized, like water molecules are. You did say this was science fantasy. All life as we know it is based on carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. These are the atoms that make the nucleic acids that form DNA. Life based on silicon, instead of carbon, has been hypothesized. I suggest that you watch the pilot episode in for the first season of Star Trek TOS. I also suggest that you make a decision on which publisher you want to submit your manuscript to and possibly join an "ideas exchange" forum. Baen has BaensBarn. Read a lot of science fiction. Reading science fiction/fantasy from the time I was 13 years old, despite my mother's once or twice a summer token objections, is what started opening up my closed mind. A thirst for knowledge, whether it is obtained through formal education or just by reading a lot, including scientific journals, which most people find quite boring, actually was fascinating for me, especially the letters sections where scientists call each other idiots or tell each other "you don't know what you are talking about, your Ph.D. mentor was also an arrogant idiot who doesn't/didn't understand this either...", may be another important factor for you to consider.Source(s): Science fiction/fantasy fan since 1966</p>>

				<li>All life on Earth requires water: It is the main ingredient in all living cells, it carries dissolved nutrients, and it serves as an internal transport medium. Life on other planets may not use water, but large amounts of some sort of liquid (possibly ammonia) would be needed.</li>
				<li>The planet's temperature must allow for the continuous existence of whatever liquid the native life is based on. This requires a nearly circular orbit around the host star or a nearly constant internal heat source such as radioactive decay or tidal friction (as on some of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn).</li>
				<li>An atmosphere dense enough to keep the liquid from boiling away is also required.</li>
				<li>Life requires energy. On Earth, that energy comes from the sun or from Earth's own internal heat, as is found around deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Any alien life will require similar sources of energy.</li>
				<li>Life requires stable conditions to form. Heavy asteroid bombardment or intense planet-wide volcanic activity could destroy the complex molecules needed for life.</li>
				<li>Life on Earth requires a large number of trace elements as well as the "Big Four" of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. Hydrogen is by far the most common element in the universe. Carbon dioxide (CO2), ammonia (NH3), water (H2O), and other simple molecules are also plentiful. Heavy elements are distributed more unevenly, however.</li>
			    </ol>
			    Free oxygen in the atmosphere is not a requirement. The oxygen in our atmosphere is a by-product of life; there was life before there was oxygen in the air. A moon or moons could help stabilize the planet's rotational axis, preventing extreme seasonal changes.

			<p>Find the surface gravity in meters per second squared. g = G(Mp) / (Rp)^2 <br> Atmosphere check! (amu = atomic mass units) m = (5.2e18 amu kg m^-1) (Rp) / (Mp) m is the minimum molecular weight for a gas to be stable in the planet's atmosphere. It must be less than 18, so that water doesn't disappear too quickly. Note: this estimate requires that the planet have a nearly circular orbit at a distance Ap from a star of luminosity Ls. If you use my curvefit to determine the planet's density, then your minimum planet mass is 0.2 Earth masses.</p>
