<h1>A Mission to Titan, Europa, or Enceladus?</h1>
<hr>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>In the last four decades, flyby probes, particularly the Voyager, Galileo, and Cassini missions, have revealed important features of the outer solar system. However, our understanding about planetary habitability and the relationship between the evolution of planets and the evolution of life has just beginning to be explored. In this context, the next great step in space science will be the exploration of the outer solar system, where planetary bodies have been emerging as potential habitable worlds. These environments provide an opportunity to extend the concept of planetary habitability (which was previously limited to Earth-like planets) and improve our understanding about the nature and distribution of habitable environments in the universe. The complexity of such endeavor requires large and expensive launch vehicles, long mission durations, highly reliable and autonomous spacecraft, and radioisotope power sources in most cases, which demand the definition of priorities and a long term exploration strategy. The present work discusses the astrobiological potential of planetary bodies in the outer Solar System in order to establish priorities for future missions.</p>
<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>In 1537, the age old belief in an Earth-centered solar system was radically shaken when Nicolaus Copernicus published "De revolutionibus orbium coelestium". His 17th-century successor Galileo Galilei was the first to discover physical details about the individual bodies of the Solar System, advancing what became known as the Copernican revolution. He discovered that the Moon was cratered, that the Sun was marked with sunspots, and that Jupiter had four satellites in orbit around it (named the Galilean moons in his honour). His remarkable observations were described in a book entitled "Sidereus Nuncius" (1610). Christiaan Huygens followed on from Galileo's discoveries by discovering Saturn's moon Titan and the shape of the rings of Saturn (Systema Saturnium 1659). And later, Giovanni Domenico Cassini discovered four more moons of Saturn and the Cassini Division in Saturn's rings.</p>
