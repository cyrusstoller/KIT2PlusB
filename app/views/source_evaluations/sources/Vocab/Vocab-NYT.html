                       <h2>Language Takes on New Significance</h2>
			    <p>RESEARCHERS are focusing with new intensity on the earliest stages of children's language acquisition as a key indicator of normal - and abnormal - development.</p>
			    <p>They say that the age at which infants smile when spoken to, say ''ah-goo,'' babble and coo foreshadow later development and may be important clues pointing to learning, sensory or psychiatric disorders and the need for early intervention to foster language development. Intervention to stimulate language ability and perhaps correct an underlying disorder, they say, may head off behavioral and learning problems that often cause family disruptions and lead to social and school failure.</p>
			    <p>At the same time, other researchers who study factors that enhance language development are finding that babies whose parents talk with, not at, them develop more rapid and richer linguistic skills. [ Page C11. ] After decades of emphasizing visual/motor skills and playing down language as a measure of a child's development, many experts now recognize linguistic skills to be the best predictor of a child's cognitive ability. Yet, they say, rarely is a child's language development assessed with the same attention that is paid to physical growth and the acquisition of such motor skills as turning over, crawling and walking or fitting pegs into holes.</p>
			    <p>To fill this gap in the care of well babies, pediatric researchers at the Kennedy Institute for Handicapped Children in Baltimore have developed a simple screening test to help physicians detect lags in language development, sometimes months before babies say their first real word, phrase or sentence.</p>
			    <p>The researchers, Arnold J. Capute, Bruce K. Shapiro and Frederick B. Palmer, all physicians and associate professors of pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, say the test can help to call attention to developmental problems like communication, hearing and learning disorders, as well as aid in the assessment of more severe problems like cerebral palsy, mental retardation and autism, that might not otherwise be noticed and treated until the child is much older.</p>
			    <p>Experts in language and child development applauded the new test, dubbed Clams, for Clinical Linguistic and Auditory Milestone Scale. The developers say the test, which has been fully standardized and validated, has already atttracted the interest of pediatricians as far away as Australia. They describe it and its potential uses in the current issue of the professional magazine, Contemporary Pediatrics. While widely used tests of child development explore some aspects of language, they focus primarily on visual/motor skills. Clams is one of the first comprehensive, systematic assessments devoted to language development.</p>
			    <p>To be sure, the ages and stages of language development, like the development of motor skills and physical growth, vary among individual babies. And boys are much more likely than girls to lag in their language development. But the Clams test can help physicians determine from parents and from the baby how closely a child's prelinguistic and language development resembles that of other children who are the same age.</p>
			    <p>For example, according to the Clams assessment, a one-week-old baby typically shows some response to sound, a four-month-old turns toward a voice, a six-month-old babbles and a nine-month-old understands the word ''no.'' By 14 months, a baby typically says three words and can respond to a simple verbal command. By 21 months, the average child's vocabulary has grown to 50 words and by age 3 to 250 words plus sentences of three words or more. A Void in Training</p>
			    <p>Currently, experts said, few physicians who care for babies are trained to detect delays in language development. When parents bring language delays to the doctor's attention, the typical response is ''Don't worry, he'll grow out of it.''</p>
			    <p>However, according to Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, a pediatrician at Harvard Medical School who is an authority on child development, such complacency is often not justified. ''In my experience,'' he said, ''when parents are worried, there's usually a good reason for it.''</p>
			    <p>The experts also agreed that early detection of language problems could have a significant impact on the child's development.</p>
			    <p>''Although early detection doesn't mean we can 'cure' every problem, early identification can be of enormous benefit to both the child and the family,'' said Judith Cooper, who runs the division of communicative disorders at the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke.</p>
			    <p>Dr. Cooper explained that parents who were aware of a language problem could learn how better to communicate with their child and to adopt more realistic expectations for how the child will respond. For example, rather than getting angry when a child fails to pay attention or to mind, the parent may learn how to elicit an appropriate response by modifying the message or the way it is delivered.</p>
			    <p>Dr. Cooper added: ''What's really nice about this tool is it will help pediatricians and family physicians become aware of what's within normal limits of language development and when they should become concerned. If a child is referred to a speech-language pathologist for evaluation, you don't lose anything if the child turns out not to have a problem. But you can lose a lot of valuable time if the diagnosis of a real problem is delayed until the child is in school.'' Identification and Therapy</p>
			    <p>Early identification of some language problems and therapy addressed to the deficiencies can minimize the damage that might result if the impairment were not recognized and treated until the child was 5 or 6 years old, Dr. Cooper said.</p>
			    <p>For many children, language difficulties impair not only reading and overall intellectual development but can also interfere with social skills and psychological adjustment, said Dr. Carl Feinstein, a child psychiatrist and director of developmental disabilities at Bradley Hospital in Providence.</p>
			    <p>A child who cannot communicate well may have trouble getting along with other children and may be inclined to use physical rather than verbal means for getting a message across. Many such children are chronically frustrated because they are so often misunderstood or are unable to perform as expected. Their egos may be repeatedly assaulted by parents and others who think they are stupid, naughty or uncooperative.</p>
			    <p>''About half the children who are treated at speech and hearing clinics have a diagnosable personality or psychiatric disorder, such as an attention deficit or conduct disorder,'' Dr. Feinstein said. ''Language problems are a major vulnerability factor that predisposes a child to other problems.''</p>
			    <p>However, experts in language development are not uniformly enthusiastic about the prospects of screening children for delays in linguistic landmarks. Catherine Snow, professor of human development at Harvard's Graduate School of Education, said there was a serious risk of overdiagnosis associated with using an assessment tool like Clams. ''Normally developing children can vary enormously in language development,'' she said. ''A perfectly normal, intelligent 18-month-old may have a vocabulary of two words or of 800 words. It is not at all unusual, for instance, for a second child to be a late talker.''</p>
			    <p>Dr. Cooper acknowledged that some children outgrew their language lag without any intervention or lasting scars. But, she added, ''most don't outgrow it and currently we have no way to know who will.'' She also emphasized that the diagnosis of a language deficit did not mean a child was not intelligent. ''In some children, language is one of several developmental areas that are delayed, but in others only language development is affected. A large percentage of children who come to speech and hearing clinics do not have other problems.'' A Detection Problem</p>
			    <p>Dr. Snow also suggested that since the Clams test relied heavily on parental observations and reports, it was much more likely to pick up problems in middle- and upper-class children than in poor children, whose parents might not be able to supply reliable information.</p>
			    <p>Nonetheless, Dr. Brazelton said: ''We're now erring on the side of missing problems. A screening test like this one gives pediatricians the feeling that they're responsible for picking up lags in language development, and that's all to the good. Language is a very sensitive indicator of child development.''</p>
			    <p>Dr. Capute of the Kennedy Institute said that until the early 1970's language was thought to develop in a haphazard fashion that was related primarily to environmental factors, such as how much mothers spoke to their children. He added, ''We now know that language develops in an orderly, sequential fashion'' that is determined more by children's innate characteristics than by their environment.</p>
			    <p>In developing Clams, Dr. Capute and his colleagues followed 381 children from birth to age 3, periodically quizzing parents about the children's prelinguistic and linguistic milestones. These measures were correlated with other standard tests of infant and child development as well as IQ at age 3. Although development of the test involved only English-speaking families in the United States, the researchers believe it should be easily adaptable to babies in other countries.</p>
			    <p>The researchers examined two complementary facets of language development: receptive milestones, which represent how a baby responds to auditory signals, and expressive milestones, which are the sounds the baby makes. Turning toward the sound of a bell or following a verbal command are examples of receptive milestones; cooing, babbling, saying da-da-da-da and forming phrases and sentences are examples of expressive milestones.</p>
			    <p>While babies may understand and respond to verbal communications long before they can create them, Dr. Capute noted: ''Expressive language milestones can never be more advanced that receptive ones. In other words, whatever comes out cannot be better than what goes in.''</p>
			    <p>Dr. Capute, who is now working in Hawaii on a sabbatical leave, said in an interview that in normal children, language development sometimes clusters. ''A child may not talk at all until age 2 or 3 and then suddenly blossom. However, more often than not, the language lag is indicative of mental retardation or a specific language disorder.''</p>
			    <p>The existence of a language disorder does not doom a child to failure in life, Dr. Capute noted. ''Einstein didn't talk until age 4 or 5. He was a genius, but he still had a language disorder. Many physicians have language disorders, but they still function well as physicians.''
