        <p>
          This is a research project being conducted by researchers at the University of Maryland, College Park, USA. 
          We are inviting you to participate in this research project because you are an undergraduate or graduate student in university.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technological advances have brought about vast changes in the worlds of information and communication in recent years. Students growing up immersed in a high-speed, trend-conscious, constantly-connected culture may have experienced a consequent shift in their understandings of the interrelated constructs of knowledge, information, and truth. The purpose of this research project is to investigate this possible shift, by taking the initial step of inquiring about students' understandings of these constructs.

          The procedures involve completing a series of three measures in a computer-based environment that supports a simulated online (i.e., world wide web) search task. These measures will be completed outside the classroom or regular class time. Participation will require access to a computer with an Internet connection. If you do not have access to your own personal computer, you will be directed to computer labs on campus. You will be directed how to access the website supporting this environment in a handout provided by your instructor; in addition, you will be encouraged to contact the researchers if you need assistance.
        </p>
        <p>
          All data collected will be stored on an external server. Data from the computer-based environment will be sent from the student's personal computer running Internet Explorer 7.0 or Firefox to a secure external Apache server running on a UNIX platform. First, you will complete the consent form and a demographic information sheet. Next, you will generate a graphic representation of the relation between knowledge, information, and truth, define these terms, and give an explanation of their generated graphic. The graphic representation will be generated by manipulating given shapes on the screen, while the definition and explanation will be typed in. You will then perform a performance task that addresses first a factual and then a more interpretive sociology-related question regarding birth rates, using a set of 8 possible sources provided in the closed online environment. You will type in their answers to each of these questions. During the performance measure, computer log files will be collected including: time on task and use of the provided sources by opening the documents in the online environment. Finally, you will report your beliefs and attitudes about inquiry as contextualized to both personal and academic activities; this involves completing the same set of 41 items twice, bearing in mind either what you do for school or what you do for their own purposes. Your responses here involve indicating the appropriate position on the given agreement scale by clicking on the screen. After responding to this self-report measure, you will also be asked to describe briefly the type of activities you had in mind for each context, by typing in a description. Completion of all measures is expected to take approximately 45 minutes.

        <p>
          We will do our best to keep your personal information confidential. To help protect your confidentiality, (1) your name will not be included on the surveys and other collected data; (2) a code will be placed on the survey and other collected data; (3) through the use of an identification key, the researcher will be able to link your survey to your identity; and (4) only the researcher will have access to the identification key. For open-ended responses, only brief quotations will be used, if at all, and care will be taken not to reveal your identity through the use of quotes. These steps ensure that participants' personal information will not be associated with the collected data.
        </p>
        <p>
          All data, including a USB drive containing completed measures and logfiles, will remain in a locked filing cabinet for a period of five years. This cabinet is located in the Disciplined Reading and Learning Research Lab (Room 3240 Benjamin Building, Department of Human Development, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, USA). After this time, the data will be either destroyed or boxed and moved to another secure storage facility. If destruction is deemed appropriate, the paper documents will be shredded and placed in a storage container, and the USB drive will be erased.
        </p>
        <p>
          Access to these data will be limited to: the student investigators (doctoral students in the Disciplined Reading and Learning Research Lab), and the primary investigator (a tenured full professor in the Department of Human Development). These graduate students are instructed as to the ethical nature of data collections and the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of study participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we write a report or article about this research project, your identity will be protected to the maximum extent possible. Your information may be shared with representatives of the University of Maryland, College Park or governmental authorities if you or someone else is in danger or if we are required to do so by US law.
        </p>
        <p>
          In accordance with legal requirements and/or professional standards, we will disclose to the appropriate individuals and/or authorities information that comes to our attention concerning child abuse or neglect or potential harm to you or others.

        <p>
          There may be some risks from participating in this research study. Specifically, completion of the measures requires cognitive effort for a sustained period of time and may generate frustration in some students.

          This research is not designed to help you personally, but the results may help the investigator learn more about how context and type of experience are related to epistemic orientations. We hope that, in the future, other people might benefit from this study through improved understanding of students' perception of the relation between knowledge, interest, and strategies.
